This is a responsive (mobile/desktop) and light-weight HTML/CSS template for building projects or personal websites. If your website does not require complex user interactions, you can use this template (index.html) without JavaScript libraries. For building interactive websites (widgets.html), you will need to include jQuery and jQuery UI. One example that uses this template is [Smell PGH](http://smellpgh.org). If you would love to keep updating this template, please avoid modifying the CSS and JS files. Instead, please keep your own style and script in index.css and index.js.<br />
